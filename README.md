# Web scraping
## Methods and data sources
### rvest library and basic knowledge about html structure have been used to scrape data from the internet; it also has codes to use the twitter API to download data from the social network database. The twitter data has been visualized to get market insights for a project.
## Privacy and website sources
### These codes have been used in consulting projects for businesses. To protect the work, the identity of the websites have been randomly changed in some cases. However, the workflow can be trasferred to other projects that involve the use of rvest library, twitteR package and their functions to carry out web scraping and data wrangling.
